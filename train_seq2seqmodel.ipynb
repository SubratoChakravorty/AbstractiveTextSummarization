    "We train a sequence to sequence model on Amazon Food reviews dataset. The input sequence are food reviews and output sequence are title for the reviews. We have a stack of three LSTMs as encoder with the third LSTM being a Bidirectional LSTM. We use LSTM along with Bahandanau's attention as our decoder. We use a custom attention.py file to implement Attention. We extend the work in this [article](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/06/comprehensive-guide-text-summarization-using-deep-learning-python/)  using Bidirectional LSTMs and Beam Search as a decoder. We tried using Rogue score to evaluate our model but since the length of summaries are typically very small. Rogue score may not be suitable for this problem."
